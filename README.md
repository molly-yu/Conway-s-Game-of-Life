# Conway's Game of Life

------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by British mathematician J.H. Conway in 1970. The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. It follows a particular set of rules, allowing the game to progress differently with changing initial states, possibly continuing infinitely.
